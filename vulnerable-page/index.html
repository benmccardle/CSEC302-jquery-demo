    <p>Say Hello to George. We don't really know what breed of dog he is, but you can be sure that he is of
        the highest quality and health standards. George here is backed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and will
        be the best companion for your household if you're looking for an active friend. George could be yours! Just
        email us at the address provided at the bottom of the page.
        (Don't know what a dog is? click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target= "_blank">here</a>)
    </p>

    <p>This here is Lucy. We also don't know about what kind of cat she is (she hasn't told us), but we know that
        she is indeed a cat. (Don't know what a cat is? click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank">here</a>)
        She's always had this weird thing going on with her eyes though, they are always very "wide."
        Regardless, you can rest assured that it will make her a unique cat! And of course, she too is of the highest
        quality standards. (We don't know what that means either) She will be the perfect companion for a family that
        is looking for a more relaxed, less interactive companion. Email us today!
    </p>

            Listen, we really need your business. We hate to tell you that our landlord is being a real pain and we need to make some money to keep this place open.
            We're even willing to clean your car. Seriously. We have a hose and a bucket out back.
